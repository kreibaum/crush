# Crush - Make your JPEGs smaller

Takes an image, scales it down to fit in 2000 pixels and then saves it as a JPEG with a target size.

Use `crush --help` to learn more.

You probably want to use https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim instead.
I would have used that too, if I found it before building this.
